<p><b>12. SUSPENSION OF FABRICATION:</b> In the event Seller is requested or required by Buyer to stop or delay the manufacture, delivery, and/or installation of said Display, for any reason or occurrence out of the control of Seller, then Buyer shall immediately pay the full purchase price or any amount remaining due to Seller.

<p><b>13. DELIVERY AND PERFORMANCE:</b> Seller shall not be held responsible for, and the period of time required for completion of any project or maintenance or repairs, shall be tolled during any time when Seller is delayed or prevented from completing the obligations hereunder because of strikes, breakage, fire, war, labor disputes, commercial delays, acts of God, regulations or restrictions of any government entity or public authority, or any accidents or forces, conditions, or circumstances beyond Seller's control, and Seller shall not be liable for any loss whatsoever suffered by Buyer, directly or indirectly, as a result of any such events. Buyer agrees to examine and inspect all installations, repairs, and maintenance, and within ten (10) days, notify Seller in writing of any complaints about work performed under this Agreement. The failure of Buyer to give such written notice shall constitute acceptance of the work performed. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be limited by any provision in which time is made of the essence. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to completion of this Agreement Seller’s prospects for payment are, in Seller’s sole discretion, impaired, Seller may require payment in advance before permitting delivery or any installation or services hereunder, and may demand Buyer’s immediate performance of its obligations hereunder. If requested by Seller, Buyer shall furnish evidence satisfactory to Seller, prior to commencement of Seller’s work hereunder or at any time thereafter, that sufficient funds are available and committed to pay the full amount owing by Buyer under this Agreement.</p>

<p><b>14. DESIGN: It is understood and agreed that Seller shall at all times have title to all original drawings, designs, and specifications relating to the work hereunder, which were developed or created by or on behalf of Seller, and Seller hereby claims copyrights, where applicable, of all such drawings, designs, and specifications. Payment of all or part of any amounts hereunder does not pass title to the "original drawing, designs, specifications" of said Display, although the same may be reproduced with the expressed written consent of Seller. Buyer shall, upon request of Seller, promptly return all drawings, designs, and specifications, and copies thereof, to Seller during all times which Buyer owes Seller any amounts hereunder.</p>

<p>15. BREACH OF AGREEMENT:</b> The parties stipulate that the Display is not an article of general trade or utility but is designed and is to be constructed and installed at the request and for the special distinctive uses and purposes of Buyer. The Display is of no value to Seller, and therefore, the Display having no resale or other value to anyone except Buyer, this Agreement is not cancelable except with expressed written permission of the Seller. Buyer shall be deemed to have breached this Agreement by insolvency, default in payment of amounts due as set forth herein, abandonment of the Display or vacating the premises where the Display is located, termination or transfer of Buyer's interest in the premises, appointment of a receiver for Buyer's business, the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition of bankruptcy with respect to Buyer, or any act or omission of Buyer in contravention to this Agreement.</p>

<p>In addition to Buyer's other obligations hereunder, in the event Seller shall institute any action or lawsuit for the enforcement of the obligations of Buyer hereunder, Buyer shall pay and indemnify Seller for all costs of court, reasonable attorney's fees expended, interest as allowed by law, and pay Seller all amounts awarded by the court as a result of such proceedings.</p>

<p>Buyer’s breach of any provision in any other Purchase or Lease Agreement or Confirmation of Order with Seller shall also be deemed to be a breach hereunder, and Seller may suspend its performance under this and all others agreements with Buyer until Buyer provides Seller with adequate assurance of performance within a reasonable time (not to exceed ten (10) days) after Seller has informed Buyer, orally or in writing, of its grounds for insecurity.</p>

<p><b>16. SECURITY INTEREST:</b> Buyer grants Seller a <b>SECURITY INTEREST</b> in the Display until all obligations to Seller are fully paid. Seller may file and record this Agreement as a financing statement under Article 9 of the Texas Uniform Commercial Code, in addition to any other permitted standard or nonstandard forms. If Buyer shall fail to pay as agreed herein, Seller (or Seller's representatives) shall have the right, and is hereby authorized and empowered to take and resume possession of, and remove into its possession, with or without process of law, the Display and all other property described herein, wherever found, and remove and sell the same at either public or private sale at such time and place as Seller shall choose, and as allowed by law, and Seller shall apply the proceeds of such sale as a credit upon the obligations of Buyer hereunder. In such event, Seller is entitled to recover all expenses of sale, including any reasonable attorney's fees necessary in handling the matter, without prejudice to Seller to the further enforcement of any balance of such obligation due Seller by Buyer, or expenses remaining due from such sale. In the event the proceeds of such sale exceed the balance of Buyer's obligation to Seller and the expenses of sale, Seller shall forward any such excess to Buyer. Buyer shall not use said Display so as to lessen the value of Seller's <b>SECURITY INTEREST</b> or impair the operation of said Display, and in the event the Display is damaged through the intentional acts or negligence of Buyer, Buyer's customers, its agents or employees, contractors or third parties, or by wind, hail earthquake, fire, war, tornado, hurricane, flood, labor disturbance, vandalism or acts of God, Buyer agrees to pay for the necessary expenses to restore said Display in operable condition. After delivery and/or installation (whichever is contracted for), in the event the Display is lost, stolen, destroyed, or otherwise impaired, Buyer shall remain liable to Seller for all amounts hereunder. <b>UNTIL BUYER'S OBLIGATIONS TO SELLER ARE FULLY SATISFIED HEREUNDER, THE PROPERTY DESCRIBED HEREIN WILL REMAIN PERSONAL PROPERTY OF SELLER WHETHER THE SAME IS ATTACHED IN ANY MANNER TO THE REALTY OR NOT. SAID PROPERTY SHALL NOT, BY REASON OF ATTACHMENT OR CONNECTION TO THE REALTY, BECOME OR BE DEEMED A FIXTURE OR APPURTENANT TO SUCH REALTY.</b> No transfer, renewal, extension, or assignment of this Agreement or of any interest hereunder, and no loss, damage, or destruction shall release Buyer or any Guarantor from the obligations assumed hereunder.</p>

<p>During all times in which Buyer is obligated for any amounts to Seller hereunder, Buyer shall keep said property free from all tax liens and other encumbrances, and any sum of money that may be paid by Seller to release any such liens or encumbrances shall be paid on demand by Buyer in addition to the obligations secured hereunder.</p>

<p><b>17. ASSIGNMENT:</b> This Agreement shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the successors, assigns, and legal representatives of the parties; provided, however, that the interest of Buyer herein shall be assigned only with the expressed written consent and approval of Seller. No transfer or assignment of this Agreement or any interest hereunder shall release Buyer from its obligations hereunder.</p>

<p><b>18. WAIVER OF CONSUMER RIGHTS: Buyer waives its rights under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Section 17.41 et seq., Business and Commerce Code, a law that gives consumers special rights and protections. Buyer stipulates it has consulted with an attorney of its own selection, and voluntarily consents to this waiver.</p>

<p>19. MISCELLANEOUS: ALL REPRESENTATIONS OF SELLER ARE STIPULATED AND SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT.</b> No modifications hereof shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by both Seller and Buyer. No waiver by either party hereto shall be a waiver of any subsequent breach of or failure to perform the same or any other term, condition, or obligation hereof. It is agreed by the parties hereto that venue of any action arising under this Agreement shall be in Bexar County, Texas, and the laws of the State of Texas shall govern this Agreement. Should any part of this Agreement contravene public policy, or laws of the jurisdiction in which it is sought to enforce the same, then such part shall be considered null and void and have no force and effect, and the balance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain valid and in full force and effect. Buyer expressly grants Seller the right to use photographs, drawings or other replicas of the Display specified herein in its brochures, pamphlets, displays or other advertising media in the ordinary course of business of Seller. Seller may place on the Display its name and telephone number and location of such information shall be determined by Seller. Buyer agrees that Buyer is purchasing said Display for business or commercial purposes or use and not for personal, family or household use or purposes. In regard to payment of any amount due hereunder, time is of the essence.</p>
